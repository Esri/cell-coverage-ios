This is the demo application shown in the Esri 2013 Developer Summit technical session: "Implementing Analysis, Editing, and Offline Applications with ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS".  The demo uses a simulated GPS location in order to better illustrate the concepts presented in the session.  It also uses the [Elevation Server Object Extension](http://blogs.esri.com/esri/apl/2010/10/07/elevation-server-object-extension/) from Esri's Applications Prototype Lab.  The application requires iOS 6.0 and above because it uses the [Cocoa Auto Layout system](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/Articles/Introduction.html) to layout user interface elements.
